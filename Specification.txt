1. Execution begins at the function main() of the multi phone script

The watch-notify pattern :

------------IMPORTANT STUFF------------

MULTI PHONE PROGRAM :

In the multi-phone program, statements are of the form :
A.watch(P,F);
Here A is a phone variable. P is a predicate (check type safety here). F is a function and nothing else.

This means watch for predicate P on phone A (TODO: if possible) and call F when it becomes true.

SINGLE PHONE PROGRAMS : 

Statements in each program are of the pattern: 
watch('<B>.Predicate','<C>.Callback')
and callbacks are of the form 
foo('<A>.Predicate')

Right now we handle :
1.P referring to a predicate on A
2.A being given
3.F being a function Declaration for sure. This is checked.

Translation :

A.watch(P,F) -->   On A : watch(P,F)  |||||  On server/some other phone B : F(P)

Assumptions :
 All function names and declarations have to be global. 

TODO:
1. Can P involve multi-phone predicates ?
2. Can A be omitted ?
3. Check that P is a well formed predicate .
4. What about other global variables and statements in the main javascript program, can we assume they run as such on the server ?
