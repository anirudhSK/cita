1. Same instructions as cita-web for setup. 
2. There is no phone text box since this a multi phone web interface.
3. The task ID by definition is shared across phones, so you don't need to copy paste it in three windows.

4. Make sure all functions are one line. This will be fixed later sometime :)
5. multiPhone.js has some sample code that you can insert into the textbox and it should work correctly assuming your device names are correct.
6. Shake detection seems to be unreliable (or) maybe it has some hysteresis ?
